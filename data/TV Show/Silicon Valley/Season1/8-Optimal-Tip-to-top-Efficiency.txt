Honestly, anyone? | 说实话，任何人？

That's why we're presenting tomorrow. | 这就是为什么我们明天要展示。
And you know what? We're going to win. | 你知道吗？我们要赢。
Yeah, we're gonna win even if I have to go into the auditorium and personally jerk off every guy in the audience. | 是的，我们要赢，即使我不得不走进礼堂，亲自为观众中的每一个男人手淫。
That's a lot of jerking. | 那可真是很多手淫。
And we only have ten minutes to present. | 我们只有十分钟来展示。
So So, we're fucked, aren't we? | 所以，我们完蛋了，不是吗？
Yeah, even if he's jerking two at a time, there are, what, 800 guys in that room? | 是的，即使他一次手淫两个，那个房间里有，有多少，800 个男人？
So that's 400 times whatever the mean jerk-time is. | 所以那是 400 乘以平均手淫时间。
- The what? - Mean jerk-time. | - 什么？- 平均手淫时间。
I mean, it doesn't matter, but, hypothetically, time is equal to 400 total jerks at a two-dick rate. | 我是说，这不重要，但，假设一下，时间等于 400 次手淫除以每次两个阴茎的速率。
Unless Erlich jerks off four guys at a time, and then we can cut that in half. | 除非 Erlich 一次手淫四个男人，那么我们可以把时间减半。
How would he do four guys? He's got two hands, so that's two dicks at a time, right? | 他要怎么手淫四个男人？他只有两只手，所以一次只能手淫两个阴茎，对吧？
Look, you have two guys on either side with their dicks, tip to tip, so you're going full-length. | 看着，你两边各有两个男人，他们的阴茎头对头，所以你是全程手淫。
Four, see? - Oh - From the middle out. | 四个，明白了吗？- 哦 - 从中间向外。
That does make sense. - Like two Shake Weights? | 这说得通。- 像两个健身球？
Yeah, so what we're trying to do, hypothetically, is minimize time, which is 800 dudes, multiplied by mean-jerk time, divided by four dicks at a time. | 是的，所以我们要做的是，假设一下，最小化时间，800 个男人乘以平均手淫时间除以每次四个阴茎。
Of course, Erlich would have to pre-sort guys by height, so that their dicks lined up. | 当然，Erlich 必须先按身高对男人进行排序，这样他们的阴茎才能排成一行。
Not by height, technically. | 从技术上说，不是按身高。
The measurement that we're looking for, really, is dick to floor. | 我们真正要找的测量方式是阴茎到地板的距离。
Call that D2F. - Huh. - Oh, my God. | 叫这个 D2F。- 哦。- 天哪。
You know, if a guy's dick was long enough, it would be able to reach up or down to another guy with a different D2F. | 你知道，如果一个男人的阴茎够长，它就能向上或向下够到另一个 D2F 不同的男人。
The longer the dick, the greater the D2F bridge, but I would still be able to jerk it off in one smooth motion I'd just have to jerk it on an angle. | 阴茎越长，D2F 桥梁越大，但我仍然可以一气呵成地手淫，我只是必须斜着来。
So D2F sub-1 needs to equal D2F sub-2, and D2F sub-3 needs to equal D2F sub-4, where length L creates a complimentary shaft angle. | 所以 D2F 下标 1 必须等于 D2F 下标 2，D2F 下标 3 必须等于 D2F 下标 4，长度 L 形成一个互补的轴向角度。
I'm such an idiot. Middle out! Middle out! Middle out! | 我真是个白痴。从中间向外！从中间向外！从中间向外！
Oh, my God. How could I? Uh Guys, does girth-similarity affect Erlich's ability to jerk different dicks simultaneously? | 天哪。我怎么会这样？呃，伙计们，阴茎周长相似性会影响 Erlich 同时手淫不同阴茎的能力吗？
Shit. Yeah, I think it would. | 该死。是的，我想会的。
Of course, it does. | 当然会。
Time to orgasm, or T2O, has to be the same for each matching pair of dicks otherwise I'm wasting a lot of great strokes on a guy that's already busted. | 达到高潮的时间，或者叫 T2O，必须对每对匹配的阴茎都相同，否则我在一个已经射精的男人身上浪费了很多很好的抽插。
Unless you can hotswap dicks in and out. | 除非你能快速替换阴茎。
So on a downstroke, you get a new one in. | 所以在向下的抽插中，你会得到一个新的阴茎。
So when you stroke up you're not wasting any energy. | 所以当你向上抽插时你不会浪费任何精力。
Even so. | 即使如此。
I think this is the most reliable metric for stamina. | 我认为这是衡量耐力的最可靠的指标。
Guys? Richard's been locked in here for almost two hours. | 伙计们？Richard 在这里被锁了快两个小时了。

Uh um We are Pied Piper. | 呃，我们是 Pied Piper。
A compression company. | 一个压缩公司。
Well, you know, in your pamphlets it says that we are a cloud based multi-platform solution for user-focused compression. | 嗯，你们的小册子上说我们是一个基于云的多平台的用户压缩解决方案。
And we were. | 我们曾经是。
Until yesterday. | 直到昨天。
But now we are not. | 但现在我们不是了。
Uh, because you see, Hooli did everything that we were tying to do, better, way better. | 嗯，因为你们知道，Hooli 做了我们试图做的一切，而且做得更好，好得多。
Um Nucleus is built on the same engine as ours, like exactly the same, and their Weissman score was 2.89, same as ours. | 嗯，Nucleus 是用和我们完全相同的引擎构建的，他们的 Weissman 分数是 2.89，和我们的一样。
But the thing is, they built a ton of really great stuff up on top of that. | 但问题是，他们在那上面构建了很多非常棒的东西。
And we can't compete, so now we have to be something else. | 我们没办法竞争，所以我们现在必须成为别的东西。
Um well-played, Hooli. | 嗯，Hooli 玩得很好。
Uh, OK, so anyway, we all know that the most obvious way to compress files is with Shannon coding, right? Top down. | 嗯，好吧，总之，我们都知道压缩文件最明显的方式是用 Shannon 编码，对吧？自上而下。
Richard, they can't see that, it's too small. - OK. - Literally, hundreds of people here. | Richard，他们看不见那个，太小了。- 好吧。- 这里有几百人。
Oh, no, but I need | 哦，不，但我需要
Shit, OK. Uh, so Shannon coding and then David Huffman came along, and he pioneered bottom up, and Lempel-Ziv with left to right, obviously. | 该死，好吧。嗯，Shannon 编码，然后 David Huffman 出现了，他开创了自下而上的编码方式，还有 Lempel-Ziv 的从左到右，显然。
And for decades, we used these codes to compress, you know, JPEGs, MPEGs, MP3s, zips, all that stuff. | 几十年来，我们用这些编码来压缩，你知道的，JPEGs、MPEGs、MP3s、zips，所有那些东西。
But we all know that, so there's no point in talking about it. | 但我们都知道这个，所以没有谈论的必要。
But what happened was, last night I was watching my friends here have this argument. | 但发生的事情是，昨晚我看到我的朋友们在这里争论。

Um Now, this morning I really only had enough time to do one test, and when I did, we hit a Weissman score of 3.8. | 嗯，今天早上我真的只来得及做一次测试，结果我们达到了 3.8 的 Weissman 分数。

Well, I'm sorry to interrupt your eloquent presentation, Richard. | 对不起，打断你精彩的演讲，Richard。
But, rather than say anything more, why don't we just give you a file and we'll see whether this thing can do what you say it does. | 但是，与其再说什么，我们为什么不直接给你一个文件，看看这个东西是否能像你说的那样工作。
Because if it can't, then we're done here, right? Yeah. Yeah, that's fair. | 因为如果它不能，那么我们在这里就结束了，对吧？是的。是的，这很公平。
So we can give you any kind of file and you can compress it, without degradation, at this standard? Three-eight? Yes yep. | 所以我们可以给你任何类型的文件，你可以按照这个标准在不降低质量的情况下压缩它？3.8？是的，没错。
All right, give us a minute, please. | 好吧，请给我们一分钟。

Wait, 24 gigs? What happened? Oh shit, there's no way. | 等等，24 GB？发生了什么？哦，天哪，不可能。

It should be twice that size. | 它应该是两倍那么大。
I mean, 24 gigs, that's less than a fourth the file size. | 我是说，24 GB，那不到文件大小的四分之一。
That seems dubious, Richard. | 这看起来很可疑，Richard。
Why don't we run a Weissman test for verification, see where we went wrong. | 我们为什么不做一次 Weissman 测试来验证，看看我们哪里出错了。
OK, I mean it shouldn't take too long, it only compressed half the fucking file. | 好的，我的意思是这不会花太长时间，它只压缩了半个他妈的文件。

It's just half the size I thought it would be. | 它只有我原来以为的一半大小。
Ladies and gentlemen, obviously we're going to keep looking at this to verify, but with a confirmed score of 5.2, Pied Piper appears to have just doubled the best Weissman score ever measured. | 女士们，先生们，显然我们还会继续查看这个来验证，但有了一个确定的 5.2 分，Pied Piper 似乎刚刚把有史以来测得的最好的 Weissman 分数翻倍了。
